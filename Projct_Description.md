Study of clearance and genetic mutation

BACKGROUND
A new drug have been pushed into clinical phase I trial focusing on the pharmacokinetics (PK).A double-blind, randomized, cross-over study design was used with two arms: placebo and 200 mg of study drug. Blood samples were collected at 30 min, 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours post dose for study drug concentration determination.
In vitro experiments have revealed that, cytochrome P450 enzymes are involved in the elimination of this drug, suggesting that subjects with certain types of genetic mutation might have various clearance of this drug. Concern rise that variants of these enzymes will have an impact on the PK of the compound. To investigate this risk, genetic testing was performed on all subjects of the phase I study.

OBJECTIVE
The study aim at investigating if certain types of genetic mutation would affect the drug clearance, based on the data of phase I study.

METHOD
Based on the collected data (genetic test result and blood concentration after administration), plots were created to gain an overall look of the time-concentration changing. 
And, in following part, t-test was run to investigate if there is significant differences in clearance between mutation and no mutation subjects. Five mutation position (T134A, G769C, A990C, G1051A and T1941A) and two mutation pattern (Homozygous and Heterozygous) are considered.

RESULT
The t-test and boxplots suggest that subject with heterozygous mutation in G1051A have lower clearance of the drug, compare to non-mutation subjects. Also, homozygous mutation in T134A and G1051A position show the same low clearance of the drug.

CONCLUSION
The result might suggest that heterozygous mutation in G1051A and homozygous mutation in T134A and G1051A position may cause a clearance reduction in this dose regimen. To confirm this condition, further study of different dosage might be desired.
